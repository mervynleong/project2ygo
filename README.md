# Yugioh Album App for GA project

App Name: My_BlueEyes_DarkMagician
Storyboarding:
I want to create an app "For Old-School Yu-Gi-Oh! Enthusiasts" to "View types of Blue-eyes and Dark-Magician Cards available and favourite them into an album. The album will be saved and allow users to view their favourite cards and which card sets they are from."

The inspiration of this app is from "Yugipedia" Phone application on Android and iOS.
The Yugipedia Phone app is a more extensive app that allows users to view cards and make a deck. Basically establishing a virtual deck builder (Bigger sized album per se).

What the App does:

First off is when the user enters the home landing page it features the screenshot below:

The user can then click on any of the 4 prompts above indicated as:

- Main Page
  This will route the user to the current landing page. If the user is not in the "Main Page".
  There is no feature for the user to interact with this page. It just acts as a home page for the user.

- Blue-Eyes
  This will route the user to the landing page below. It shows all the available "Blue-Eyes" archetype in the Yu-Gi-Oh! card game.

  Each and every card (Image) will be shown and they will depict the card_sets available if it is an official released card.
  There will be an option to add card to "Album" to store the images and card sets as a "Favourtied Card". Similarly to an actual album in real life, the user can add multiple copies of the same card and store into the album. (This is not a bug, it is an intentional feature).

- Dark-Magician
  Similar to "Blue-Eyes" landing page above, the "Dark-Magician" landing page will direct the user to a page where it shows all available "Dark-Magician" archetype in the Yu-Gi-Oh! card game as shown below.
  Each and every card will also be shown and can be added to the "Album" as well.

- Album
